## . Exercise_8 - Abundant Number
It is checked whether the entered number is an abundant number.<br/>
**Abundant Number:** In number theory, an abundant number or excessive number is a number that is smaller than the sum of its proper divisors. The integer 12 is the first abundant number. Its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 for a total of 16. The amount by which the sum exceeds the number is the abundance. The number 12 has an abundance of 4, for example.
