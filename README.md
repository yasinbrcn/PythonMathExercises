## . Exercise_6 - Greatest Common Divisor
Greatest common divisior of two number is calculated.<br/>
The data type of entered value is checked. If data type is not integer and entered number from lower than zero, the error message is show.<br/>
## . Exercise_7 - Least Common Multiple
Least common multiple of two number is calculated.<br/>
The data type of entered value is checked. If data type is not integer and entered number from lower than zero, the error message is show.<br/>
## . Exercise_8 - Abundant Numbers
It is checked whether the entered number is an abundant number.<br/>
**Abundant Number:** In number theory, an abundant number or excessive number is a number that is smaller than the sum of its proper divisors. The integer 12 is the first abundant number. Its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 for a total of 16. The amount by which the sum exceeds the number is the abundance. The number 12 has an abundance of 4, for example.<br/>

## . Exercise_9 - Prime Numbers
All prime numbers up to the number entered user are displayed.<br/>
**Prime Number:** A prime number is a number that is only divisible by itself and 1 without a remainder.<br/>
First 10 prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29...
## . Exercise_10 - Collatz Sequence
The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture that states that all natural numbers greater than 1 can be reduced to 1.<br/>
This conjecture can be show as a function as follow.
